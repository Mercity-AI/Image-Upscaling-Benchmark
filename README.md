There are several methods for image upscaling, including classical techniques, deep learning methods, GAN-based approaches, and diffusion-based models. In this discussion, we will explore how to perform image upscaling using each of these techniques. We'll evaluate the efficiency of each model, analyze their size, and examine their performance metrics, such as Mean Squared Error and SSIM (Structural Similarity Index Measure).
